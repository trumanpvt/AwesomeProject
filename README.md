# AwesomeProject

For IOS/Android.

This is my sample application, my first experience in React Native + Typescript + MobX. For backend i'm using Firebase.

Features:
- SignUp/SignIn with login/password or with OAuth (Google/Facebook)
- User management, like changing name or avatar
- News feed
- EN/RU languages

Todo:
- everything else
- fix current

I haven't any plans about this app, it's just my sandbox.
